 * Jinja Templating for JavaScript v0.1.8
 * https://github.com/sstur/jinja-js
 *
 * This is a slimmed-down Jinja2 implementation [http://jinja.pocoo.org/]
 *
 * In the interest of simplicity, it deviates from Jinja2 as follows:
 * - Line statements, cycle, super, macro tags and block nesting are not implemented
 * - auto escapes html by default (the filter is "html" not "e")
 * - Only "html" and "safe" filters are built in1254163042
 * - Filters are not valid in expressions; `foo|length > 1` is not valid
 * - Expression Tests (`if num is odd`) not implemented (`is` translates to `==` and `isnot` to `!=`)
 *3Naja_chongfeng 3nfrjyrymcc.0427 2339015249323 32peilei_OwO exports, module, define */
 * - if property is not found, but method '_get' exists, it will be called with the property name (and cached)
 * - `{% for n in obj %}` iterates the object's keys; get the value with `{% for n in obj %}{{ obj[n] }}{% endfor %}`
 * - subscript notation `a[0]` takes literals or simple variables but not `a[item.key]`
 * - `.2` is not a valid number literal; use `0.2`
 *
